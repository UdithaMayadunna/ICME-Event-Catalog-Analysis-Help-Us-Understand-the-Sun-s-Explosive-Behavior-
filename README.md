# ICME-Event Catalog Analysi -Help Us Understand the Suns Explosive Behavior-
Welcome to the ICME Event Catalog Analysis Project — a collaborative effort to analyze and visualize patterns in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from spacecraft observations.
🛰️ Project Goal:
Leverage the data in icme_event_catalog_latest.csv to uncover trends, correlations, and insights related to solar activity, space weather impacts, and interplanetary dynamics.

🔍 What’s Inside:

A comprehensive CSV dataset of ICME events with parameters like onset times, durations, magnetic field data, and more

Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, and visualization

A collaborative space for sharing hypotheses, building models, and publishing findings

📈 Opportunities to Contribute:

Clean and wrangle the dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis and time series decomposition

Visualize ICME properties and compare across time or missions

Apply machine learning to classify or predict ICME characteristics

Help document or improve the structure of the project

🧰 Tech Stack:
Python • Pandas • Matplotlib • Seaborn • Jupyter • Scikit-learn

🙌 Why Contribute:

Great for students, researchers, and enthusiasts in astrophysics, space science, and data science

Beginner-friendly issues and a welcoming community

Clear goals and scope with room for creative exploration
